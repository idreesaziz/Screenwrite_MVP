Abstract base class for AI-powered media analysis providers.

This provider handles multimodal AI analysis of various media types:
- Images (JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- Videos (MP4, MOV, YouTube URLs, etc.)
- Audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.)
- Documents (PDF, etc.)

Supports asking questions about media content and getting AI-generated answers.
