# Blueprint Architecture Implementation

## Overview

The blueprint architecture provides a structured, type-safe approach to video composition alongside the existing string-based system. This implementation maintains full backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities.

## Key Files

### Core Architecture
- **`BlueprintTypes.ts`** - Interface definitions for all blueprint components
- **`BlueprintComposition.tsx`** - Main blueprint renderer with track/clip system
- **`executeClipElement.ts`** - Safe clip code execution and duration calculation

### Enhanced Components  
- **`DynamicComposition.tsx`** - Updated to support both string and blueprint modes
- **`TestBlueprint.tsx`** - Demonstration and sample blueprint data

### Exports
- **`index.ts`** - Clean exports for easy importing

## Usage

### String-based (Existing)
```tsx
<DynamicVideoPlayer
  tsxCode="return <div>Hello World</div>"
  compositionWidth={1920}
  compositionHeight={1080}
/>
```

### Blueprint-based (New)
```tsx
const blueprint: CompositionBlueprint = {
  tracks: [
    {
      id: "track1",
      clips: [
        {
          id: "clip1",
          startTime: 0,
          duration: 3,
          code: "return React.createElement('div', {}, 'Hello Blueprint')"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
};

<DynamicVideoPlayer
  blueprint={blueprint}
  renderingMode="blueprint"
  compositionWidth={1920}
  compositionHeight={1080}
/>
```

## Features

### Automatic Duration Calculation
Blueprint compositions automatically calculate their duration based on clip timing.

### Multiple Rendering Modes
- **TransitionSeries**: Sequential clips with transitions
- **Sequence**: Overlaid clips (default)

### Built-in Transitions
- Fade in/out
- Slide animations  
- Scale effects
- Custom transition timing

### Type Safety
Full TypeScript support with comprehensive interfaces.

### Error Handling
Robust error handling for clip execution with visual error display.

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Structured Data**: Clear separation between timing and content
2. **Reusable Clips**: Clips can be easily duplicated and modified
3. **Timeline Management**: Precise control over timing and transitions
4. **Scalability**: Easy to extend with new clip types and effects
5. **Maintainability**: Type-safe interfaces prevent runtime errors
